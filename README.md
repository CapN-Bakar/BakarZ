Hi, I'm BakarZ ðŸ‘‹.

  I'm a Computer science student who enjoys learning more about web accessibility, web development best practices, and how to become a better, more efficient programmer overall. I do this by reading documentations, taking courses, building projects, and posting about things I learn on Facebook stories.
